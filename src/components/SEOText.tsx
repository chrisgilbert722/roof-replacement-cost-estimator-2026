                Understanding Roof Replacement Costs in 2026
            </h2>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                Roof replacement is one of the most significant home improvement investments you can make. The total cost depends on several key factors including roof size, material choice, roof pitch, labor rates in your area, and whether existing layers need removal. This calculator provides ballpark estimates to help you budget for your project before getting contractor quotes.

                Roofing Material Comparison
            </h3>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                <strong>Asphalt shingles</strong> remain the most popular choice due to their affordability ($4–$7 per square foot installed) and 20–30 year lifespan. They work well on most roof pitches and come in many colors. <strong>Metal roofing</strong> costs more upfront ($7–$14/sqft) but can last 40–70 years with minimal maintenance, making it cost-effective long-term. <strong>Tile roofing</strong> ($10–$20/sqft) offers excellent durability and fire resistance, popular in warmer climates. <strong>Slate</strong> is the premium option ($15–$30/sqft) with potential 100+ year lifespan, but requires specialized installation and structural support due to its weight.

                Factors That Increase Costs
            </h3>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                <strong>Roof pitch</strong> significantly affects labor costs. Steeper roofs (9:12 pitch and above) require additional safety equipment, slower work pace, and specialized techniques—adding 10–25% to labor. <strong>Tear-off</strong> of existing shingles adds $1–$2 per square foot for removal and disposal. Most building codes allow a maximum of two roofing layers, so homes with existing layers often require complete tear-off. <strong>Complexity</strong> matters too: roofs with multiple valleys, dormers, skylights, or chimney penetrations require more time and materials for proper flashing and sealing.

                When to Replace vs. Repair
            </h3>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                Minor issues like a few missing shingles or small leaks can often be repaired. However, full replacement is typically recommended when: your roof is approaching its expected lifespan (20+ years for asphalt), you see widespread granule loss, multiple areas show curling or buckling shingles, there's visible sagging or structural damage, or repairs would exceed 30% of replacement cost. Getting multiple professional inspections can help you make an informed decision.

                Permits and Additional Costs
            </h3>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                Most jurisdictions require permits for roof replacement, typically costing $100–$500 depending on location. Disposal fees for old roofing materials add another $100–$400. If your project uncovers damaged decking or structural issues, expect additional costs for plywood replacement ($50–$100 per sheet installed) or rafter repairs. Consider bundling gutter replacement with roofing work—contractors often offer package pricing since scaffolding is already in place.

                <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: 'var(--color-text-primary)', marginBottom: 'var(--space-1)' }}>
                    How long does a roof replacement take?
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                    Most residential roof replacements take 1–3 days for asphalt shingles. Metal, tile, or slate installations may take 1–2 weeks depending on complexity and crew size.
                </p>

                <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: 'var(--color-text-primary)', marginBottom: 'var(--space-1)' }}>
                    What time of year is best for roof replacement?
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                    Late spring through early fall typically offers the best weather conditions. Asphalt shingles need temperatures above 40°F to seal properly. Avoid peak summer heat if possible, as extreme temperatures can affect installation quality.
                </p>

                <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: 'var(--color-text-primary)', marginBottom: 'var(--space-1)' }}>
                    Should I get multiple quotes?
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                    Yes, always get at least 3 quotes from licensed, insured contractors. Compare not just price but also materials specified, warranty terms, timeline, and references. The lowest bid isn't always the best value.
                </p>

                <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: 'var(--color-text-primary)', marginBottom: 'var(--space-1)' }}>
                    Does homeowner's insurance cover roof replacement?
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                    Insurance typically covers roof damage from sudden events like storms, hail, or fallen trees—minus your deductible. Normal wear and aging are not covered. Review your policy and document any storm damage promptly.
                </p>

                <p style={{ fontWeight: 600, color: 'var(--color-text-primary)', marginBottom: 'var(--space-1)' }}>
                    What warranty should I expect?
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                    Roofing warranties have two parts: manufacturer warranty on materials (typically 25–50 years for shingles) and contractor workmanship warranty (usually 1–10 years). Get both in writing before work begins.
                </p>

                    Can I roof over existing shingles?
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--space-4)' }}>
                    Sometimes. Most codes allow one overlay layer if the existing roof is flat and in decent condition. However, tear-off is recommended to inspect decking, provides better results, and doesn't add extra weight to your structure.
